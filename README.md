### Reversi player

This is an artificial intelligence that learns to play reversi. It's a version of Othello with specified starting position. By installing necessary libraries and then running one of the main files (main_dqn.py or main_policy.py) we start an agent that learns how to play the game reversi. In turns it trains and tests itself against a random player, achieving 95% win rate after some epochs.
